        <h1>About 3STAT</h1>
        <p>The goal and purpose of the Short-term Algorithmic Stock Market Strategies (referred to as 3STAT going forward) project will be to assess and implement an algorithm to successfully trade 3X leveraged ETFs (exchange-traded funds). With guidance from the project sponsor, the algorithm will be assessed and developed against historical market data, and then implemented with current market data. The successful implementation of the algorithm will culminate in a web application that notifies the users of specific buy and sell signals.
